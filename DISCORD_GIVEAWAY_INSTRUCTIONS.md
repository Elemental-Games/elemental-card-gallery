## Quick Send Options

### Option 1: Manual Send via Resend Dashboard (FASTEST)
1. Go to [resend.com](https://resend.com) and log into your account
2. Click "Send" or "Create Campaign" 
3. **From:** `Elemental Games <noreply@elementalgames.gg>`

### Option 2: Fix Environment Variables & Use Automation

#### Step 1: Fix Your .env File
Your server is missing the Resend API key. Add this to your `.env` file:

```bash
# Add your Resend API key (get it from resend.com/api-keys)
RESEND_API_KEY=re_your_api_key_here

# Your existing Supabase variables should already be there:
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_key
```

#### Step 2: Restart Server & Send
```bash
# Stop current server
pkill -f "node server.js"

# Start server with environment variables
node server.js

# Send the Discord giveaway email
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/send-discord-giveaway-email \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{}'
```
