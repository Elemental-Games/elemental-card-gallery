# Elekin: Masters of Kinbrold - Rulebook

## Introduction
Welcome to Elekin: Masters of Kinbrold, a strategic trading card game where you harness the power of elemental creatures and ancient magic to defeat your opponents. As a Master of Kinbrold, you'll command powerful creatures, cast devastating spells, and utilize tactical shields in your quest for victory.

## Getting Started

### Game Overview
In Elekin, two players face off in a battle of strategy and skill. Each player starts with:
- 500 health points
- A deck of 40-60 cards
- 3 shield cards (one of each tier)
- 5 cards in their starting hand

### Basic Concepts
- **Essence**: The game's resource system, featuring four elements (Air, Water, Fire, Earth)
- **Creatures**: Your main fighting force, each with unique abilities and essence generation
- **Runes**: Powerful spell cards that can enhance creatures or affect the battlefield
- **Counters**: Trap-like cards that can be played during your opponent's turn
- **Shields**: Defensive cards that protect you and provide powerful effects when broken

## Core Mechanics

### Turn Structure
Each turn consists of six phases:
1. **Draw Phase**: Draw one card
2. **Generation Phase**: Generate essence from your creatures
3. **Main Phase 1**: Summon creatures and play cards
4. **Battle Phase**: Attack with your creatures
5. **Main Phase 2**: Play additional cards
6. **End Phase**: Clean up and prepare for next turn

### Playing Cards
- You can have up to 5 creatures on your field
- Creatures require essence matching their element to summon
- Runes and Counters can be played face-down
- Each creature can only use one ability per turn

### Combat
Combat in Elekin is determined by two key stats:
- **Strength**: Determines damage dealt
- **Agility**: Determines attack order and dodge ability

When creatures battle:
1. Higher agility creature strikes first
2. Damage equal to strength is dealt
3. If defending creature survives, it counter-attacks
4. Effects trigger after damage resolution

## Advanced Rules

### Shield System
Shields are your last line of defense:
- Tier 1 Shield: 150 health
- Tier 2 Shield: 300 health
- Tier 3 Shield: 450 health

When a shield is broken:
- Choose one of two powerful effects
- Effects cannot be countered
- Shield cannot be replaced

### Chain Resolution
When multiple effects trigger:
1. Last effect played resolves first
2. Active player's effects have priority
3. Shield effects always resolve last
4. Each player can respond to effects

### Special Card Types

#### Dragon Cards
Dragons are powerful dual-element creatures:
- Require essence from two elements
- Can use either element for abilities
- Often have powerful special abilities
- Generate multiple types of essence

Example:
```
Frost Dragon
Elements: Air + Water
Cost: 2 Air, 2 Water
Stats: 200/150
Ability: Generate 1 Air and 1 Water essence
Special: Freeze target creature (2 Air, 2 Water)
```

#### Equipment Runes
Permanent enhancements for creatures:
- Attach to one creature
- Stay on field until destroyed
- Can modify stats or add abilities
- Limited to one per creature

Example:
```
Storm Blade
Type: Equipment Rune
Cost: 2 Air
Effect: +50 Strength
Special: Can attack twice if only Air essence used
```
