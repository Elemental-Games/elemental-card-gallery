          <p className="text-lg">
            When Balon chose this region, they recognized the power in its diversity. Through mastery of earth magic, 
            we've become stewards of every terrain - the verdant forests, life-giving rivers, mysterious caverns, and 
            even the challenging badlands. Our cities blend seamlessly with nature, built both among the treetops and 
            within the earth itself.

            <p className="text-lg">
              Life in Grivoss flows with the rhythm of nature itself. Our forest cities rise organically from the earth, 
              connected by bridges both above and below ground. The Stone Guardians patrol every terrain, from the 
              mushroom-lit caverns to the windswept badlands. In the ancient ruins, scholars study the wisdom of past 
              civilizations, while in our fertile valleys, earth elementals help cultivate the richest harvests in all of Kinbrold.
