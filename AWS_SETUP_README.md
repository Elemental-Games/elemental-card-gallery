# AWS Setup and User Authentication Guide for Elemental Masters

This guide will walk you through the process of setting up AWS services and implementing user authentication for the Elemental Masters application.

## Prerequisites

- An AWS account
- Node.js and npm installed on your local machine
- The Elemental Masters project code

## Steps

1. Set up Amazon Cognito
   - Go to the AWS Management Console and navigate to Amazon Cognito
   - Create a new User Pool
   - Configure sign-up and sign-in options (email, username, etc.)
   - Set up app clients (enable necessary OAuth flows)
   - Note down the User Pool ID and App Client ID

2. Set up AWS Amplify
   - Install AWS Amplify CLI: `npm install -g @aws-amplify/cli`
   - Configure Amplify: `amplify configure`
   - Follow the prompts to set up your AWS credentials

3. Initialize Amplify in your project
   - In your project directory, run: `amplify init`
   - Follow the prompts to name your environment and select your AWS profile

4. Add Authentication to your project
   - Run: `amplify add auth`
   - Choose "Default configuration" and "Username" as the sign-in method
   - Confirm your choices

5. Push changes to AWS
   - Run: `amplify push`
   - This will create the necessary resources in your AWS account

6. Update your .env file
   Add the following variables to your .env file:
   ```
   VITE_AWS_REGION=your_aws_region
   VITE_AWS_USER_POOL_ID=your_user_pool_id
   VITE_AWS_USER_POOL_WEB_CLIENT_ID=your_app_client_id
   VITE_AWS_OAUTH_DOMAIN=your_oauth_domain
   VITE_AWS_REDIRECT_SIGN_IN=http://localhost:5173/
   VITE_AWS_REDIRECT_SIGN_OUT=http://localhost:5173/
   ```
   Replace the values with your actual AWS configuration details.

7. Configure Amplify in your app
   In your main.jsx or App.jsx file, add the following:
   ```javascript
   import { Amplify } from 'aws-amplify';
   import awsconfig from './aws-exports';
   Amplify.configure(awsconfig);
   ```

8. Implement authentication UI
   Use the `Auth` object from `aws-amplify` to implement sign-up, sign-in, and sign-out functionality in your components.

9. Test your authentication flow
   - Run your application
   - Test the sign-up, sign-in, and sign-out processes
   - Verify that user data is being stored in Amazon Cognito

## Troubleshooting

- If you encounter CORS issues, ensure your app's URL is added to the allowed origins in your Cognito User Pool app client settings.
- For any AWS-specific errors, check the AWS CloudWatch logs for detailed error messages.

## Next Steps

- Implement protected routes in your application
- Add social sign-in options if desired
- Set up MFA for enhanced security

Remember to never commit your AWS credentials or sensitive information to version control. Always use environment variables for sensitive data.
