## üí° **CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTORS**

### **1. Email Conversion is Key**
Your 122 subscribers are gold. If you convert even 30% immediately, that's 37 followers from people who already know you.

### **2. Local Visits = Guaranteed Followers**
Game stores are perfect because people are already interested in games. Your conversion rate should be 60%+ in person.

### **3. Speed Over Perfection**
You need volume and velocity. Post 3x per day, try different approaches, move fast.

### **4. Direct CTAs Always**
Every single piece of content must end with "Follow our Kickstarter for early access."

### **5. Track Everything**
Know exactly which tactics are working so you can double down.

---

## üî• **BACKUP PLAN: If Behind Pace**

### **If <100 Followers by Day 7:**
- Increase ad spend to $200/day
- Launch emergency email to all subscribers
- Do additional game store visits
- Reach out to bigger influencers with paid partnerships

### **If <250 Followers by Day 10:**
- All-hands content blitz (5+ posts/day)
- Emergency influencer partnerships ($500 budget)
- Reddit/Discord promotion in every relevant community
- Personal outreach to every email subscriber

**This strategy flips your approach from "awareness building" to "conversion optimization." You're not trying to build a perfect community - you're trying to hit 500 Kickstarter followers in 14 days. Once you hit that goal, THEN you can go back to the long-term strategy.**

**The clock is ticking. Execute fast, measure everything, and adjust daily. You've got this! üöÄ**
